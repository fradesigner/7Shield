# 7Shield by Kibana 7.16

Kibana is your window into the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products). Specifically, it's a browser-based analytics and search dashboard for Elasticsearch.

## Getting Started MAIA Dashboard

1 Step
 git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/7Shield.git kibana
 cd kibana
-------
2 Step
Install dependenciesedit
Install the version of Node.js listed in the .node-version file. This can be automated with tools such as nvm, nvm-windows or avn. As we also include a .nvmrc file you can switch to the correct version when using nvm by running:

 nvm use
-------
3 Step
Bootstrap Kibana and install all the dependencies:

 yarn kbn bootstrap

( In any other circumstance where you want to force the node_modules install step you can use: yarn kbn bootstrap --force-install ) 


If you have failures during yarn kbn bootstrap you may have some corrupted packages in your yarn cache which you can clean with:

yarn cache clean
-------
4 Step

Configure environmental settingsedit
Increase node.js heap sizeedit
Kibana is a big project and for some commands it can happen that the process hits the default heap limit and crashes with an out-of-memory error. If you run into this problem, you can increase maximum heap size by setting the --max_old_space_size option on the command line. To set the limit for all commands, simply add the following line to your shell config: export NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=2048".

## Run Elasticsearchedit
Run the latest Elasticsearch snapshot. Specify an optional license with the --license flag.

yarn es snapshot --license trial

-------
5 Step
Run Kibanaedit
In another terminal window, start up Kibana. Include developer examples by adding an optional --run-examples flag.

yarn start

Version Compatibility with Elasticsearch

Ideally, you should be running Elasticsearch and Kibana with matching version numbers. If your Elasticsearch has an older version number or a newer _major_ number than Kibana, then Kibana will fail to run. If Elasticsearch has a newer minor or patch number than Kibana, then the Kibana Server will log a warning.
